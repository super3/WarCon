WarCon
======

WarCon is a top down, turn based, strategic warfare simulator. It takes its 
roots from gams like Advanced Wars (for GameBoy) and the Battalion series. 
Unfortunately these great games are only available on old and outdated 
platforms, or are no longer maintained by the developers. This is an attempt
to bring back this awesome genre with a free and open-source game. Enjoy!
